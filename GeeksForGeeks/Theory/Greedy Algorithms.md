# Greedy Algorythms

## General
* Approach: Builds the solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece tht offers the most
  obvious and immediate benefit.
* Purpose: Used when choosing the most optimal solution @ each step of the problem gives the best
  overall solution.

## Advantages
* If a problem can be solved greedily, the greedy solution will be the most efficient solution, 
  more effective then dynamic programming.

## Disadvantages
* Greedy algorithms do not reconsider their choices, Unlike DP, which is exhaustive and
  guarantees we find an optimal solution even if we do not have optimal local choices leading to
  optimal global choices.
