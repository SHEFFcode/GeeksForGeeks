Djikstra's Theory:

In order to understands Djikstra's Algorithm, we must understand how to convert a graph into an adjacency array.

Consider the graph  below:

We can think of it as something like this:

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   4   0   0   0   0   0   8   0
1   4   0   8   0   0   0   0   11  0
