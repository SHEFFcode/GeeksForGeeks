# Class Structure
## General
Class structure has to do with how we structure our classes. We really only have two options:
* Using Inheritnace
  * Extending parent classes or implemnting interfaces.
  * We can also declare abstract classes and methods.
  * We can encapsulate and hide away certain functionality.
  * We can use private / protected methods and classes to better protect business logic.
  * "Is a" approach.
* Using Composition
  * Adding new functionality through delegration.
  * Instantiating additional classes inside broader class, and using their functionality to implement.
    any required functions of the object as a whole.
  * Allows for decorator pattern and state machine pattern
  * "Has a" approach
